                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>This section contains my work history that is relevant to the STEM field. I've had a few other jobs other than the ones listed, but those involved either working in a gross kitchen or working in a boring office. As a result, I didn't feel like listing them.</p>

                <h2>Lead Instructor - iD Tech</h2>
                <p><strong>Atlanta, Georgia 2019</strong></p>
                <p>Most of the job involved teaching various classes on Game Development to Middleschool through Highschool aged students. The classes I taught ranged from VR Game Development using Unity to Mobile Game Development using GameMaker Studio 2.</p>
                <p>On top of teaching, many of my functions involved debugging students' code, fixing hardware issues, solving dependency issues, etc. As a result, I became much better at adapting to situations on the fly.</p>
                <p>This job had a lot of different responsibilities as well. Several administrative and customer service responsibilities, such as managing medical paperwork, assiting families, check-in/check-out, etc.</p>

                <h2>Co-Creator - Vicimus</h2>
                <p><strong>Indianapolis, Indiana 2017 - 2019</strong></p>
                <p>This was a Game Development company that a friend and I created. We both had a passion for Game Development, so we worked together to make a few different games. Most of the games we made were for GameJams that we would then flesh out later.</p>
                <p>My main role on the team was the Lead Artist, so I was responsible for 2D art, character designs, and animation. However, I also contributed to everyother aspect of the games as well.</p>
                <p>I left the team due to being too busy with work to continue. However, around the time I was leaving our entire team was also trying to head in a direction that I was unsatisfied with, which is why I haven't returned to the team. That being said I am still good friends with everyone on the team.</p>
